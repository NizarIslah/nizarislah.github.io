Hello! I am a 2nd year PhD student at Mila Quebec AI Institute in Montreal, supervised by Eilif Muller and Irina Rish (Universite de Montreal). My primary research interests are in a) developing novel algorithms and architectures which address the stability-plasticity tradeoff in neural networks (at all scales), such that they can continually accumulate knowledge and skills, and b) discovering the inductive biases that allow for efficient representation learning. 
Outside of research, I love playing and watching soccer (football).

Some recent work:
* Nizar Islah*, Diganta Misra, Timothy Nest, Matthew Riemer, Irina Rish, Eilif Muller. Mitigating Mode Collapse in Sparse Mixture of Experts (Poster @ NeurIPS NewInML Workshop 2023). Arxiv: TBD
* Nizar Islah*, Guillame Etter*, Mashbayar Tugsbayar*, Tugce Gurbuz, Blake Richards, Eilif Muller. Learning to combine topdown context and feedforward representations under ambiguity with apical and basal dendrites (2023). Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05484
* A New benchmark for Continual Learning for Code Generation. Arxiv: TBD

I am always open to collaborate or discuss ideas! Feel free to reach out to me through any/all channels.
