Hello! I am a 2nd year PhD student at Mila Quebec AI Institute in Montreal, supervised by Eilif Muller and Irina Rish (Universite de Montreal). My primary research interests are in a) developing novel algorithms and architectures which address the stability-plasticity tradeoff in neural networks, such that they can continually and efficiently accumulate knowledge and skills, and b) modelling the mechanisms that support continual learning in the human neocortex. Given the recent trend in foundation models and neural scaling laws, there is great interest in making these models continual learners, given that they are still prone to catastrophic forgetting, and training such models from scratch is incredibly wasteful. My goal is to bring insights from continual learning literature to addres some of the failure modes of these models to build agents which can effiently accumulate new information and capabilities. Outside of research, I love soccer and long-distance running.

My current projects follow these themes:

1) Modular and sparse networks for continual learning (such as sparse Mixture-of-Experts)

2) Multimodal (vision, language, code, etc) continual learning

3) Designing challenging benchmarks to inspire new approaches for continual learning

I am always open to collaborate or discuss ideas. Feel free to reach out to me via email, twitter, or slack.
